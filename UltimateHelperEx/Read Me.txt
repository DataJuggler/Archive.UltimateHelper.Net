This folder is an exact copy of the base DataJuggler.Core.UltimateHelper.

The only difference is this is a strongly typed version for use in COM projects like Regionizer.

Hint: Best Ultimate Helper I can think of is a butler. Sadly 'all' of mine quit due to lack of pay

This folder directory is actually DataJuggler.Core.UltimateHelperEx which is a copy of the base
UltimateHelper code set used for Strongly Typed projects. If any changes are required, 
the changes should be made to the base, as eventually someone smart will join this project
and tell me how to push the code from the base to the strongly typed version automatically 
as a post build event or something.

Are you that smart person that knows how to push code for an automatic build. 

Your hired! 

Open source doesn't pay very much, but there is lots of job security in it as people 
will still expect everything to just magically work.

Post a comment somewhere on this project's home and I will see it, or I will have the time
to work on this 2021 3rd quarter, maybe.
